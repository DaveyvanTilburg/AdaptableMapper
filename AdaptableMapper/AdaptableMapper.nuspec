    <releaseNotes>
0.7.0
  - MappingConfiguration.ObjectConverter is now called ResultObjectConverter
  - Added a new interface ResultObjectConverter, hopefully clarifying its intent
0.6.4
  - Added validation tests for mappingconfiguration and mapping to validate if all properties are set
0.6.3
  - Some more minor fixes for the model/xml/json targetinitiators and objectconverters
0.6.2
  - Some minor fixes in null checks and returning the correct default value on error
0.6.1
  - Finished implementation of Json setters
0.6.0
  - Error handling revised to information gathering.
    - Error namespace renamed to process
    - ErrorObserver renamed to processObserver
    - Error object renamed to information with a new property type (currently string value 'warning' and 'error')
    - Information with the type 'error' are considered critical errors that will always fail (due to type convert errors or impossibilities)
    - Information with the type 'warning' will have information about paths that failed to resolve, searches that came up empty and other traversal information
0.5.1
  - Type check errors include type name instead of serialized object with no type info
0.5.0
  - Redone error messages
  - Added verbose error observing
0.4.3
  - Release fix

0.4.1
  - Rename inconsistency
0.4.0
  - Added Json traversals (getters)
  - Added extra error handling checks
0.3.2
  - Added jsonignore to parent property of ModelBase so Json doesn't give the recursive error. (ModelBase should not be serialized for storage anyway)
0.3.1
  - Release bugfix
0.3.0
  - Added model scope traversal to behave like XPath scope traversal, it now return every match, not only first in each step of the path
0.2.0
  - Added a way to change the result type
0.1.0
  - Renamed object Adaptable to ModelBase (and all related objects)
0.0.1
