!! I don't know if this should be categorized as mapping or serialization... any thoughts?

# XPathSerialization

A package for any to any mapping without hardcoding

## Plans

Completed plans:
 - Create an algorithm flexible enough to support any to any conversion
 - Soft error handling (through observer)

Current plans:
 - Fully test and create the Xml conversion implementation
 - Fully test and create the Memory conversion implementation

Future plans in relative priority order:
 - Implement Json conversion
 - Write documentation

## How to use

Mock up of structure and flow:
